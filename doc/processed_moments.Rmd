#libraries
```{r load libraries, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(tm)
library(tidytext)
library(tidyverse)
library(DT)
library(wordcloud)
library(RColorBrewer)
library(dplyr)
```

```{r read data, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
urlfile<-'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rit-public/HappyDB/master/happydb/data/cleaned_hm.csv'
hm_data <- read_csv(urlfile)
#hm_data=read_csv('/Users/yeyejiang/Desktop/CU/Spring 2019/GR5243/happydb/data/cleaned_hm.csv')
dim(hm_data)
length(unique(hm_data$hmid))
length(unique(hm_data$wid))
```

### Step 2 - Preliminary cleaning of text

We clean the text by converting all the letters to the lower case, and removing punctuation, numbers, empty words and extra white space.

```{r text processing in tm}
corpus <- VCorpus(VectorSource(hm_data$cleaned_hm))%>%
  tm_map(content_transformer(tolower))%>%
  tm_map(removePunctuation)%>%
  tm_map(removeNumbers)%>%
  tm_map(removeWords, character(0))%>%
  tm_map(stripWhitespace)
```

### Step 3 - Stemming words and converting tm object to tidy object

Stemming reduces a word to its word *stem*. We stem the words here and then convert the "tm" object to a "tidy" object for much faster processing.

```{r stemming}
stemmed <- tm_map(corpus, stemDocument) %>%
  tidy() %>%
  select(text)
```

### Step 4 - Creating tidy format of the dictionary to be used for completing stems

We also need a dictionary to look up the words corresponding to the stems.

```{r tidy dictionary}
dict <- tidy(corpus) %>%
  select(text) %>%
  unnest_tokens(dictionary, text)
head(dict,10)
```

### Step 5 - Removing stopwords that don't hold any significant information for our data set

We remove stopwords provided by the "tidytext" package and also add custom stopwords in context of our data.

```{r stopwords}
data("stop_words")

word <- c("happy","ago","yesterday","lot","today","months","month",
                 "happier","happiest","last","week","past",'happiness','weeks')

stop_words <- stop_words %>%
  bind_rows(mutate(tibble(word), lexicon = "updated"))
```

### Step 6 - Combining stems and dictionary into the same tibble

Here we combine the stems and the dictionary into the same "tidy" object.

```{r tidy stems with dictionary}
completed <- stemmed %>%
  mutate(id = row_number()) %>%
  unnest_tokens(stems, text) %>%
  bind_cols(dict) %>%
  anti_join(stop_words, by = c("dictionary" = "word"))
head(completed,10)
```


### Step 7 - Stem completion

Lastly, we complete the stems by picking the corresponding word with the highest frequency.

```{r stem completion, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
completed <- completed %>%
  group_by(stems) %>%
  count(dictionary) %>%
  mutate(word = dictionary[which.max(n)]) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  select(stems, word) %>%
  distinct() %>%
  right_join(completed) %>%
  select(-stems)
head(completed,10)
```

### Step 8 - Pasting stem completed individual words into their respective happy moments

We want our processed words to resemble the structure of the original happy moments. So we paste the words together to form happy moments.

```{r reverse unnest}
completed <- completed %>%
  group_by(id) %>%
  summarise(text = str_c(word, collapse = " ")) %>%
  ungroup()
head(completed,10)
```

### Step 9 - Keeping a track of the happy moments with their own ID

```{r cleaned hm_data, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
hm_data <- hm_data %>%
  mutate(id = row_number()) %>%
  inner_join(completed)
datatable(hm_data)
```

### Exporting the processed text data into a CSV file

```{r export data}
write_csv(hm_data, "/Users/yeyejiang/Documents/GitHub/Spring2019-Proj1-yeyejiang/processed_moments.csv")
```
